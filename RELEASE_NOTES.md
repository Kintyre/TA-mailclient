#Release Note
This technology adapter add-on fetches emails for Splunk to index from mailboxes
using either POP3 or IMAP, with or without SSL.

The modular input also stores takes the password from inputs.conf in plain text,
and replaces it with a place holder, while storing it encrypted within Splunk.
This is built using the Splunk SDK for Python,
should work on any Splunk installation with Python available including SHC.
Passwords should also get replicated between search heard peer members.

At present, this only fetches emails form the 'inbox' folder.
